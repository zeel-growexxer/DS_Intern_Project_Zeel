Some states, such as Florida and New York, have a significant number of risk factors, with over 30,000 and 27,000 respectively. On the other hand, some states, such as South Dakota and Wyoming, have relatively few risk factors, with less than 300.\n\nThe majority of states have a mix of risk factors, with some having more risk factors in certain categories than others. For example, California has a large number of risk factors in the 1-4 categories, while Texas has a larger number of risk factors in the 1-4 categories.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some states have a higher proportion of risk factors in certain categories. For example, California has a higher proportion of risk factors in the 1-4 categories, while Texas has a higher proportion of risk factors in the 1-4 categories.\n\nOverall, the distribution of risk factors across different states is complex and varied, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to understanding the distribution of risk factors.", "Bot"], ["What is the distribution of car ages for customers who are not homeowners?", "User"], ["The distribution of car ages for customers who are not homeowners is as follows: \n\nThe majority of non-homeowners have cars that are between 2 and 10 years old, with the largest proportion (10.63%) having cars that are 1 year old.
